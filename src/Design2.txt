- thread.h: + struct file *executable
			  This refers to executable of the thread. i.e argv[0]
- syscall.: + void syscall_ext_exit (int status)
			  This is an external method that calls sys_exit.
			  Used in exception.c
- process.c: + static int setup_user_stack (void **esp, char **save_ptr, char *token)
			   This function is used to set up the user program stack. 
			   Here we push argv[] and argc to the stack.
			   

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
We separate the command from the arguments using strtok_r(). The first value
is the command. Then, we take the rest, iterate until the token is no more. 
We make sure the arguments passed in are in the right order by first incrementing
the count, and placing it in the argv array at index count. This way the arguments
are passed in as how you type it your raw command string. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
The _r versions of functions are reentrant, meaning you can call them from
multiple threads simultaneously or in nested loops. It takes multithreading
into its full potential. 
In general, you'd want to use strtok_r() rather than strtok unless you need
to make your code compatible to prevous systems that only support strtok().

1) It gives us the opportunity to check erros before passing the commands 
to the kernel which ensures the kernel has less error checking to do
when commands are passed to it.
2) Since it saves the kernel time and energy, there is less overhead.

The least possible number of inspections of the page table is 1. If 
the data is distributed in byte sized segments across all 4096 bytes,
 the greatest possible number would be 4096 times.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
